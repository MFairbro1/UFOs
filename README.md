# UFOs

## Overview

### The goal of this exercise was to create a web application using Javascript and HTML to display information about UFO sightings. The web application would have to have filtering functionality, allowing users to filter sightings by date, location, and shape of the UFO.


## Results

### All the UFO sighting data is stored in a table. In order to filter the data, one could make use of the filtering fields on the left hand side of the table. Users can filter by a number of fields like shape and date. All they would have to do is input a filter in the relevant field and make sure it is typed in the same format as the sample text already present in the field. More than one field can be filled at a time:

## Summary

### One drawback of the webpage is that it immediately filters the data based on the previous filter criteria when the user clicks in a different field to enter a new filter criteria. The webpage could be improved if clicking on a different filter field did not immediately filter the table based on the previous filter entry. Also, the addition of a filter button would be convenient, as users would not have to hit the "enter" key or click in another filter field to filter the data.
